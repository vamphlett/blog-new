# What's next for me!

Here we go again, another year, another adventure! So, as most people will already know after selling my house in San Antonio in November 2022, I loaded up my car and took an 8 day road trip across to NYC. 

The plan was to find a new house with no close neighbours, (obviously), upstate NY or Pennsylvania, but alas that has not happened.

Fast forward 15 mths and I have a new plan!

As a kid I always loved the thought of travelling in an RV or camping, and that time has now come. With a fair amount of anticipation and fear, all being well I will depart upstate on May 11th, 2024 and hopefully get across the US, and back, over the next year, or possibly longer. I will be working as normal along that way, so not quite living the dream but none the less I'm excited to have this opportunity while I still have my health and most of my marbles.

I'd love to have you follow me along the journey and maybe I will see you for a visit while on the road.....
