# Fifth stop, Savannah, GA - Saturday 8th June, 2024


[Red Gate Farm, Savannah, Georgia 12 Night](https://www.redgatecampground.com)

Another pretty easy 2 1/2 hour drive further south to Savannah, GA. No, still hate the towing but with no other options I have to keep going.
Going to be at this one for a while so was careful again to book a great quiet park with excellent reviews.
Spent a quiet evening with a stroll round the beautiful property and lovely horses.

Up and about early on Sunday for a trolley tour downtown Savannah which is only a 15 min drive from the site. Obviously we were under a heat advisory with the hottest day of the year - how's my luck!
Despite the heat Savannah was just as beautiful as I expected with amazing historic houses and beautiful treelined streets.

Needing some relief from the heat I did one of the many historic home tours and the Prohibition Museum.

The working week was pretty quiet with a few shopping trip's, lunchtime pool visit, laundry, oh and a new hair do finally.
For a change I get another weekend in the same place due to my friend coming into NY for a visit from NZ next week, so I needed somewhere to leave my Camper and fly out and back.
Saturday the 15th, another hot and sweaty day! Headed out to another plantation for what amounted to a long walk LOL. Not much going on there.

Sunday I headed north again over the boarder to Beaufort, South Carolina to visit a good work friend - Mike, for the day. Wow what a beautiful place I do love these small old colonial towns on the water. Was given the tour of the area, a lovely lunch, and a pretty wildlife area in the State Park. Was a real treat to finally see Dolphins in the wild, despite their shyness when I grabbed the camera.

 Up for an 8.00 a.m. walking tour of [Bonaventure Cemetery](https://visitsavannah.com/profile/bonaventure-cemetery/6129)
This totally deserves the title of most beautiful cemetery in the US. It's gorgeous and so interesting listening to the history.

Moving the camper into a dry storage spot for the next 5 days. Looking forward to a visit with my lovely friend Natalie and her 2 kids on their stop over in NY before they head on to England.
