# Second stop, Williamsburg, VA - Saturday 18th May, 2024

[Thousand Trails RV resort, Williamsburg, Virginia 7 nights](https://thousandtrails.com/virginia/williamsburg-rv-camping-resort/?utm_source=yext&utm_medium=directory&utm_campaign=Yext%20Directory%20Listing)

After a pretty wet week in PA, it was no surprise to wake up to it still raining, and not lightly. To say terror and anxiety filled my whole being would be an understatement. I had already pretty much done my tear down, (packing up camping language), last night, but still had to hook up to the car and finish the last few bits. As I sat watching my check out time approach rapidly there was a sudden window of light drizzle about 10:30 a.m. Still panic stricken at the thought of towing in the rain I had no choice. 

Really nothing much to say but the supposed 4 hour drive actually took 7.5hrs of non stop rain, and brakes that decided to lock up just to add to the most frightening experience I can remember to date - yes in my life, and I've jumped out of a moving plane, twice!

Arrived into the new campsite about 6 p.m., to find they had put me in a heavily wooded site, despite requesting a sky view for my satellite dish. After a very quick golf cart ride around the vacant locations, declining a spot next to a howling dog, we found an option. Was grateful it was a pull through site so no messing about backing in. 

My first spillage - oh well! was past caring at that point. Quick hoover and all cleaned up.

After finding a pretty small space in the sky, and setting up the internet, I was ready to fall into bed for the night, eating a family pack of popcorn for dinner. Had read some not so good reviews on this campsite, so I was very happy to find that although the sites were pretty close together everyone was super quiet and my kinda people, PHEW. Also very close to the highway but not too bad.

Up for a much calmer day on Sunday. The choice was Roller coasters at Busch Gardens or [Colonial Williamsburg.](https://www.colonialwilliamsburg.org/explore/seasons/Spring/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=tickets-brand&utm_content=cwf-tickets-spring-visitation-2024&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw6auyBhDzARIsALIo6v_azdxqkO3WjeB3xYj9UehgtPm94P1q-bvofEw6RlKhjTryn6ADn5MaAqI4EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) With enough stress the day before I decided on the Colonial.

What an awesome place. It was huge, and so well done, and finally I had a nice spring day to enjoy the outdoors for some great historic talks and tours the village offered.  Must have heard how terrible the Brits were at least 10 times LOL. Definitely recommend a visit if anyone is in the area.

The rest of the week was thankfully pretty eventless with the exception of another electrical scare with the tow hitch. Quick visit to a local auto garage and we are all good.
Was impressed with the clientele in the park, everyone was lovely and quiet, even the many home schooled kids that live on the road full time. Peaceful days working, and quiet evenings watching TV, or having a small walk round the park. Not sure my crime shows are the best choice for a Solo female traveller :-)

I have decided the drive to my next stop in Myrtle Beach is a little too long for me, so providing the rain holds off I am going to leave on Friday afternoon and head south for a few hours to reduce Saturdays driving. I'm a big fan of a new camping site I found called [Hipcamp] (https://www.hipcamp.com/en-US), and no they are not hippies and you don't require tie dye! It's generally private land like Breweries, Farms, etc. that have anything from only 1 site to 6 or 7, so that will be my quick over night stop for Friday.

Next stop: Mrytle Beach, SC
