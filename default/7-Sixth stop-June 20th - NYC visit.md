# Sixth stop, NYC, NY - Thursday 20th June, 2024


[Empire Hotel, NYC, NY 3 Night](https://www.empirehotelnyc.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gbp_listing)

Quick 2 hour flight from Savannah to NY, with a bonus free upgrade to Delta comfort so a little extra room. Super expensive taxi ride into the city to meet my long term Yorkshire friend and her to Kiwi kids at the hotel. With jetlag an excitement running wild we headed out for a walk into Times Square to do the tourist stuff, M&M madhouse, and of course NY Pizza.

Sods law mad it the hottest temperatures this year. Heatwave anywhere is bad enough but in the middle of NYC it's definitely not much fun.

Finally back at the hotel, quick showers then bed. Kids up at 3 a.m. so of course I was up to. Off for an early Friday morning NY Diner breakfast, quick dip in the postage stamp size hotel rooftop pool, Central Park Boating Lake, subway to the Staten Island Ferry to do a float past the Statue of Liberty, twice :-), 911 Memorial, Oculus Subway station. Weather was pretty miserable and like a sauna outside but what can you do.

Back uptown to one of my favorite cheesy places for dinner, Ellen's Stardust dinner. Just fun and the kids loved it. Slow walk back to the hotel for what turned out to be a nice 11 hours kip for the kids phew.

Saturday  - another scorcher. Off to the West Village to take a photo of the Friends apartment building LOL Not my idea but will never complain about spending time in that area. Popped into the English shop for an overpriced but yummy sausage roll and a packet of crisps, then over to the Westside Highway via the Highline, Little Island, and the Pier that the Titanic should have arrived on, had it made it.

Back to the hotel for showers and a change for tonight's Hard Rock Cafe dinner andWicked Broadway Show. 2 out of 4 loved it, not really my cuppa tea and a teenage boy was bound to sleep right through LOL.

Sunday morning we headed to the Met Museum to see the Rooftop exhibition - of course it was closed due to heat, typical. Such a beautiful building and massive so you really need a few days to enjoy it properly. One more mode of transport for them to try, jumping on the bus back to Times Square for the apparently very famous Raising Canes Chicken. Despite the rush I have to say it was really nice and an on site DJ was fun too.

And in a blink of an eye if was time for them to leave for their UK flight. I finally managed to get to the Apple store and get a new phone, then headed to Elaine's to shower and crash for the night before my flight back to Savannah on Monday morning.
