After a fairly smooth early morning departure to my first campsite in Gettysburg, PA, I was relieved I had a nice sunny morning, with no wind, which helped with the nerves. I even managed to stop at a Truck Stop Gas/Petrol station, filled up, and roll onto the Truck Stop weighing scales to check my vehicle limits - with the help of a friendly, not serial killer like, trucker :-) 

Onwards for a slow but steady drive. Lessons learned, if the sat nav says 4 hrs, expect 5 hrs when towing, and hold tight when be trucks come barreling past. Arrived at the site about 2 p.m. Not a fan of the "thanks for coming now find a space that is available" approach, but I am told it's the norm. Lots of seasonal sites here so not all had humans in (always a bonus) but none the less difficult to find a spot. 15 mins in and I find a nice little end spot next to my very friendly neighbours, Judy and Wyatt, or Wayne, or Bruce, or something....

Pretty happy with my backing in skills aided with a few left and rights from Wyatt. Should be plain sailing from here and fun right! Errr No. Yet another electrical issue leaving me with zero outlets to plug anything into, including my Starlink internet. Pretty sure this is why people wait till they are retired and don't care about having contact to the outside world. Deffo not for me.

My neighbours were kind enough to let me piggy back off their electric, although unfortunately by the time I got back from the shop, (just to get phone signal to tell people I was alive), they had unplugged me and hopped off to bed.

Evening spent doing a crossword, with a cuppa, chocolate, and yet another rain storm. Feels like England lately.

With the weather and the total wipeout of Sunday trying to fix the electrics, I finally found a nice local RV electrician to get me up and running, sightseeing and goat yoga was off the cards. Guess  I can read about Gettysburg online. Spent the remainder of the very wet week just running errands, working, and organizing the camper a little better, along with a very nice invite to a BBQ at my nice neighbours next door.

All in all it was a comfortable first week to get settled. The campsite was really friendly and super helpful, and the cute animals were a bonus.

Getting cozy and set up, plus learning how to cook in a small space :-)

Ready for the 4hr plus drive onwards to Virginia. Oh and his name was actually Walt :-)
