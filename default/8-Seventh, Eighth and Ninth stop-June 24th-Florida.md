# Seventh, Eighth and Ninth stop - Monday 24th June, 2024


[Long Branch Ride and Rest, Live Oak, FL - 4 nts](https://longbranchrestandride.com) and [Black Creek Lodge RV Park, Freeport, FL - 1 nt](https://www.blackcreeklodgerv.com) and [Azalea Acres RV - Loxley, AL - 1 nt](https://www.azaleaacresrvpark.com)

Starting my journey to Texas so the next 3 stops are purely for rest, rather than a sightseeing opportunity, so I am posting as 1.

Long Branch was an awesome stop where horses go on their hollibobs with their owners. Place was super relaxing with wide open fields. Totally enjoyed this break. Minus the scary storms.

Onwards to what looked like a nice quiet site for the next 2 nights. Can only be described as hell so chucked in the ear plugs, suffered the noise, and found a new place 2 hours further west early the next day.

Phew, what a great spot and I was already in Alabama so making progress.  Would have definitely stayed here longer if I wasn't on a time crunch to get to Texas, but was lovely never the less. Laundry done in between the storms, and a nice quiet night ready for the off to New Orleans tomorrow.
