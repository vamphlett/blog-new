# Third stop, Myrtle Beach, SC - Saturday 25th May, 2024


[Sun Outdoors, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina 8 Night]https://www.sunoutdoors.com/south-carolina/sun-outdoors-myrtle-beach?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gbp_listing)


OK my first hipcamp fail, well kind of. Wasn't raining on Friday night so decided to try and head south a few hours to stop for a quick overnight just to sleep. Booked a private land stop and started out. Of course it started to rain almost immediately so I eventually got to the house about 3 hours or so later. It was starting to get dark and to my horror the house was a shack in the middle of a junk yard out of a scene from Saw the movie. The drunk dirty, old fat guy final remembered I was coming and came to greet me.  After finding the large carving knife I locked up and got into bed. Up and about as early as possible for the remainder of the trip south.

This was a far longer trip than I had first anticipated but at least it was dry, which was a huge relief. Had a quick stop for breakfast and a few rest breaks so arrived about 5 p.m. just in time for a corker of a thunderstorm.

Beautiful, well keep park but the word resort was the key. Unfortunately, not the best location to find yourself on Memorial weekend but not much I could do about it.  Talk about Butlins or Ibiza on steroids. Apparently they have an entertainment schedule in the club house every night but don't worry you don't have to participate coz they pump the base into your camper for free lol Imagine my joy!

Earplugs purchased! Game changer.

Had a nice evening out with my work friend and a quick trip to the beach to take a look around.

Easy Monday morning holiday day then headed out to my friends for some sightseeing to the boardwalk and dinner. After arriving at his house and forgetting not to touch the dog I saw the fluffy thing sitting there and decided to pet it. Err nope. The rest of the day was spent in the Urgent Care with the first real dog bite I had got in 53 years. To say it hurt was an understatement but nothing broken.

The campsite had thinned out a little after Monday which made for a better week. Did get to take a nice walk in a local park, used the pool a little, and cooked outside on the grill.

Friday night we headed to a cruise-in car club in a great little town called Conway. Weather was lovely and the cars and music made for a great evening. Driving in a 1958 Buick Century without seatbelts was a fun experience.

Definitely ready for a quiet site so Saturday morning was spent leisurely packing up ready to hit the road Sunday morning.

Booked a Dolphin watching sightseeing boat trip for Saturday afternoon, sadly no dolphins but a nice way to spend a few hours on the water.
