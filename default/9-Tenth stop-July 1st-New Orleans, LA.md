# Tenth stop-July 1st-New Orleans, LA


[Bayou Segnette State Park, New Orleans, LA - 3 nts](https://www.lastateparks.com/parks-preserves/bayou-segnette-state-park) 

My first state park. With my company shut down for the 4th of July week, I get a nice week off work to enjoy in New Orleans. Rolled into the state park earlier than the normal check in so was able to take a drive round and find a nice spot that worked for me. Was very quiet, no doubt because it's so bloody hot down here, and anyone with any sense has headed North for the summer.
After what I can only describe as impressive parking LOL, I backed into my sight, levelled, and set up, all while dripping in the humidity. Spent the rest of the day inside the camper with the AC cranked up, with a quick trip to the grocery store for shopping.

Lovely quiet night in the park which felt a little unnerving not having anyone around Haha seriously you can't win with me. I headed into the city for a 2 hours City and Cemetery Bus Tour, no way I was doing it on foot with this heat so the AC was awesome. No comments needed but not sure why I always seem to get the nut jobs gravitating to me. Thankfully she was not a Trumper, although she felt the need to tell me no one was taking her guns LOL Yeh I suddenly needed another wee and a pretend phone call to escape.

We met in a famous location that's specialty were Beignets - just fried donuts minus the hole. It was no surprise they were yummy and as a bonus you can only buy them in 3's so result.

Very informative tour around the city, learning about the history and seeing some amazing homes. Had a quick stop at a cemetery which are pretty cool and certainly nothing you see anywhere else I have been to.  Not sure I fancy the $100K cost of a family vault but apparently you can buy the plot for $25k and build your own. My brick laying is pretty good so I'll take that option please.

Had a quick walk round after the bus tour then back to the camper for a nice shower before heading back for my 8 p.m. Vampire, Ghost, and French Quarter Walk.  Really enjoyed this walk and saw a totally different view of the homes in the French Quarter, along with the history and great stories, despite their pretty dark theme.

Wednesday  - my last day here. Off for a 2 p.m. Steamer paddleboat ride. I decided not to drive into downtown again with the million dollar parking fees, so went to the oldest neighborhood in New Orleans and got the local 12 minute ferry across the river.
