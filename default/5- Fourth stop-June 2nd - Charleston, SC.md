# Fourth stop, Charleston, SC - Sunday 2nd June, 2024


[Oak Plantation, Charleston, South Carolina 6 Night] (https://www.oakplantationcampground.com/index.html)


Nice easy drive for 3 hours south to the historic town of Charleston, SC.
I was so glad I picked a no frills basic campsite with great reviews that included words like tranquil, peaceful, quiet. Right up my alley.

Headed straight out for some sightseeing to [Magnolia Plantation and Gardens] (https://www.magnoliaplantation.com/). Totally what I expected from a southern plantation, despite its not so wonderful history it was a beautiful property with stunning gardens in full bloom. Took the lazy route round on the little trolley tour and saw amazing birds, turtles, and a ton of alligators.

Monday and Tuesday was bliss sitting out till late, using the nice quiet pool, and just generally enjoying this peaceful campsite.

Wednesday I headed out to Downton Charleston for a walk round. It did not disappoint, beautiful architectural, clean quiet streets, and huge colonial homes worth a small 5-8 million dollars. After my walk I enjoyed a nice fish and chips with some live music in the pub before heading back to bed.

2:30 a.m. my first nighttime storm. Wow pretty scary listening to the thunder and extreme heavy rain pound the camper.  I was eyeing up my evacuation route to the bathroom block across the field until it finally passed about 5 a.m.  Not fun.

Definitely ready for a quiet site so Saturday morning was spent leisurely packing up ready to hit the road Sunday morning.

Booked a Dolphin watching sightseeing boat trip for Saturday afternoon, sadly no dolphins but a nice way to spend a few hours on the water.
