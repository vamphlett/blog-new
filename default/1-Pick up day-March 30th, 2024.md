#  Pick Up Day - Saturday, March 30th, 2024

Hi ALL

How today went!

Up and about with the birds for the 3 hour drive further North, upstate from Callicoon to Syracuse. After never having towed anything in my life I was grateful for the company of my friends Brummy Hubby, Jason, for pick up day. 

A sunny clear day was a blessing  and a huge relief. Arrived at the RV dealers by 10:30 for a few hours of very, very basic induction, and a quick driving lesson round the car park. Apparently once you hand over the big bucks you are on your own to do as much damage as you want out in the real world.

I have been doing my research for over a year now so am super happy with the [Rockwood GeoPro FD19](https://forestriverinc.com/rvs/rockwood-geo-pro/G19FD/8020) that I finally went with. At only 21ft long if felt the smallest option I could get without scarifying workspace and bathroom, plus I could still keep my normal car.

After a pretty eventless drive home, at a respectable 50-60mph,  the fun starts with a reverse parking situation back at my friends property, where i could stay for a while to practice and learn, before I hit the road.

Fast forward an hour or so, a few grey hairs, and the odd tree branch detachment, and I'm in situ.

Now to settle and get my millions of dollars of Amazon stuff - your welcome Jeff Bazos!
