# First few days Moochdocking!

## ==Where to start....== 

So I decided, despite having no electric hook up for the camper, to move into the trailer and give it a little test. After 3 days of sleeping and working in there I was all out of battery. Well that's that. 

Despite having a fairly good solar package, and a new upgraded lithium battery it was as dead as dodo. On a normal basis the sun would have given me a little top up power but with 4 days of constant rain, and now snow since I got it home, it's game over.

All toasty for a while back in the safety and comfort of the house - phew.

Watch this space - I'll be back after a well needed trip to Austin to visit friends and family.
